# Frame Level Classification of Speech
The task was to use a feedforward neural network for speech recognition.  We were provided with a dataset of audio recordings (utterances) and their phoneme state (subphoneme) labels.  We were asked to identify the phoneme state label for each frame in the test data set. It is important to note that utterances were of variable length.  For more information on the project I have left the link to the Kaggle Competition with the data below.
